Learning a new language can be hard, messy, and complicated. That's why we made Vict - a product that gives you access to your own in-app translator.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### A better way to translate

Unlike google translate or other translation services, Vict works with all Mac products inside applications like facebook messenger, instagram, imessage, and more.
Vict allows you to replace text with another language or read information about translation options.
Vict works locally and does not require an internet connection. 

### Access to over 10,000 words and 1,000 common english phrases translated in over 10 languages. 


### About Vict

Vict was inspired by a desire to make language learning easier and less time consuming. The creators of Vict wanted to give each and every person access to their own personal translator they can tailor to fit their own personal needs.
