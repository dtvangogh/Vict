### Access to over 10,000 words and 1,000 common english phrases translated in over 10 languages. 
Vict works locally and does not require an internet connection.

### Vict works on all mobile IOS devices!


### About Vict

Vict was inspired by a desire to make language learning easier and less time consuming. The creators of Vict wanted to give each and every person access to their own personal translator they can tailor to fit their own personal needs.
